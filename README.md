### Hi there 👋
I'm Kittapat Ratanaphupha, who is studying in an undergraduate program of Health Data Science, CPE KMUTT, expect to graduate in May 2022.

At now, I and @savefd are doing a senior project about machine learning with fluxomics data for Cassava growth rate prediction.

😎 What I'm interested in:
1. Geometry (such as Differentiable Manifold, Geometric Analysis)
2. Another pure mathematics, mathematical analysis
3. Digital signal processing, e.g., image processing and speech processing
4. Dynamical systems for physical model
5. Machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence

🖥 I've worked by informal internship with Government Big Data Institute (GBDi) <br>
*Data Science internship, June - August 2020*
-	Data-science team I've joined is working for Department of Revenue in online market taxing.
-	Extract personal information in social listening which was ingesting sale-relating posts.
-	The work was done by a team of 2 with querying a regular expression and wrangling a dataset.
