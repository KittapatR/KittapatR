2. Another pure mathematics, mathematical analysis

What field I'm interested to learn:
1. Digital signal processing, e.g., image processing and speech processing
2. Computer architecture and theory of computation
3. Dynamical systems for physical model
4. Machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence

**Work and Experiences**
